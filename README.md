### Hola 👋


This is Javier aka 'Javi' a software engineer by day and a never-ending learning developer by night. I specialize in front-end development and mobile development. But, I have a curious mind and like to dabble by building 💻 PCs and tinkering with raspberry PIs from time to time. I live in 🌞 FL in the city that is the “Horse 🐎 Capital of the World."

I am also a Co-Organizer for GDG Central Florida 🚀 & DevFest Florida 🌴🏖 - Florida's most magical developer conference. Trying to give a vision to the dev community while helping us learn about new technologies and a better understanding of the current ones. 


### 📚 I’m currently read the following topics:
